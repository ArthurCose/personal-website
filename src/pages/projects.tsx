        A tool to find license and project info in npm dependencies, generates a

        A fork of <Link href="https://github.com/mlua-rs/mlua">mlua</Link>. Adds
        the ability to snapshot and rollback the Lua VM, only tested with Lua
        5.4 and rarely updated to avoid introducing new bugs.
        <br />
        <br />
        Used in <Link href="https://hub-os.itch.io/hub-os">Hub OS</Link> for
        implementing rollback netcode for mods, without modders needing to think
        about rollback or netcode.

        name="Red Moon Lua VM"
        icon={redMoon}
        repo="https://github.com/ArthurCose/Red-Moon"
      >
        This is similar to{" "}
        <Link href="https://github.com/Hub-OS/rollback-mlua">
          Rollback mlua
        </Link>
        , with the main feature difference being serialization for sharing VM
        state to another person over the network. This allows players to jump
        into an ongoing session with no effort from the modding side.
        <br />
        <br />
        Shelved as the effort of integrating into{" "}
        <Link href="https://hub-os.itch.io/hub-os">Hub OS</Link> is too high to
        currently justify, but I occasionally revisit this project to try
        improving upon it.
