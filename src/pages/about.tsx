      <h2>Hi, I'm Arthur</h2>

      <p>
        I am a Software Developer with professional experience in C++,
        TypeScript, React-based frameworks, and MongoDB. I also frequently use
        Rust, Lua, SQL, and have minor experience with PHP and Python.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        In my free time, I work on a few projects for various online
        communities, but I've excluded links to these projects to separate my
        personal and online lives.
      </p>
