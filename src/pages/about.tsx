      <h2>Hi, I'm Arthur</h2>

      <p>
        I am a Software Engineer in the EST time zone with professional
        experience in C++, JavaScript + TypeScript, React-based frameworks, and
        MongoDB.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        Outside of professional experience, I frequently use Rust, Lua, SQL, and
        have minor experience with PHP and Python.
      </p>
      <br />

      <p>
        In my free time I work on a few projects for various online communities,
        but I've excluded links to these projects to separate my personal and
        online life.
      </p>
    </>
